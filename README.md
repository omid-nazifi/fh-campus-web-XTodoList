# fh-campus-web-XTodoList
The main purpose of the XTodoList is to keep track and "not forget anything". Actually, everything on the list must be done. If you still don't manage to get everything done, it would be annoying and unwise if unimportant things are done and important things are left undone. That's why there are priorities: determine what is important.
